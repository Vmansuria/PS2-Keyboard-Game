# PS2-Keyboard-Game
Utilized open source game and integrated PS2 keyboard to use arrows keys for movement.
Linked the 7-segment display to output the player's score which is just time that they survive.
Mapped the reset button to reset the game and timer when the user wants to retry.
typical design flow consists of creating model(s), creating user constraint file(s), creating a Vivado
project, importing the created models, assigning created constraint file(s), optional running behavioral
simulation, synthesizing the design, implementing the design, generating the bitstream, and finally verifying
the functionality in the hardware by downloading the generated bitstream file.
